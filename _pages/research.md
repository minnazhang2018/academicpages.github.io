*The Relation Between Petroleum Product Prices and Crude Oil Prices , (with Louis H. Ederington, Chitru S. Fernando, Thomas K. Lee, and Scott C. Linn), February 2021, Energy Economics, 94, 105079.*\

**Abstract:** We present an empirical examination of the relation between real spot Brent oil prices and real spot petroleum product prices, specifically gasoline and heating oil prices. Based upon weekly price data spanning a 30-year period ending in April 2019, we provide consistent evidence of Granger causality running from oil prices to product prices accounting for both non-stationarity of the series, and separately conditional heteroskedasticity. No evidence of Granger causality from product prices to oil prices is found for the full sample period nor the period up to the end of 2005, but evidence that gasoline prices Granger-caused oil prices is found for post-2005. Similar results are found for an extended model that also includes potentially endogenous real market variables related to supply and demand in the oil, heating oil and gasoline markets. Given the reduced form model results that oil prices Granger-cause gasoline and heating oil prices, we specify and estimate recursively identified structural vector autoregressive models that specifically account for structural supply and demand shocks in the oil market as well as the petroleum product markets. The oil market block follows Kilian (2009). We find that real spot gasoline prices and real heating oil prices do not respond to structural oil supply shocks, respond transiently to global commodity demand shocks, but do respond to oil-specific demand shocks. We conclude the result that spot oil prices Granger-cause spot gasoline and heating oil prices largely occurs through the channel of oil-specific demand shocks.

### *Skewness and Kurtosis, Real Options, and Investment Under Uncertainty (sole-authored)*
**Abstract:** This study shows the impacts of the skewness and kurtosis of price returns on the decisions of irreversible investment projects. The traditional Real Options Valuation does not consider the higher-order moments of price returns, when many assets’ distributions prove to be non-normal and have non-zero skewness and(or) excess kurtosis. Using the modified Real Options Valuation and the Black-Scholes option pricing models, this study shows the effect of skewness and kurtosis on the value of real options to postpone irreversible project investments when the distribution of the output price returns is not normal. The relationship between drilling dates and changes in production states of each oil well in four U.S. states, amounting to 53,000,000 well-month observations, and changes in the skewness and kurtosis of well output – oil return distribution risk-neutral moments from  2010 to 2019 - is examined to explore the impact of higher-order risk-neutral moments on investments. The results show that real options under non-normal explain investments; the investment decisions do not support the preference theory. Oil firms’ choices on the timing for drilling new wells and closing existing wells, as well as the timing of temporarily shutting in producing wells, are influenced by return skewness and kurtosis. The results suggest that the derivatives market provides unique information which the equity market does not contain.
